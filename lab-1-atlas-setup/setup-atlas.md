# Setting up Mongo Atlas

## Step-1: Create an Account

Sign up for atlas here : https://www.mongodb.com/atlas

Login to your account

## Step-2: Create a Free Instance

- You can choose any cloud instance
- Choose 'FREE' tier
- Follow the guide.
- Note your username and password to connect to the instance
- For IP access list, add `0.0.0.0/0` .  This makes it available to test from Google Colab. (Note: this makes the instance available from any IP address)



## Step-3: Load Sample Data
