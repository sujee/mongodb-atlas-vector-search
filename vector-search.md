# Vector Search Explained

"Vector Search  represents data as vectors in a high-dimensional space and performs searches based on the similarity between these vectors"

For example, let's say we are searching movie plots.

- A simple **keyword search** could be **'sci-fi'**
- A **vector search** could be **'where humans fight aliens'**

Here is an example.  Notice how the results are not merely keywords.

```text
